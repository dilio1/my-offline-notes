# my-offline-notes
Simple TODO app for offline notes


###TODOS: 

* Mark notes as readed
* Better option for switching between lists
* Delete specific notes
* Add subnotes
* Preview note on full screen
* Global shortcut to get the application on focus
* Add max text overflow - hide too long notes titles
* Add a way for editing notes (and subnotes)
* Maybe change the DB structure - {title: "title", notes: []} to {title: "title", text: "text"} and add text index on the "title" property
